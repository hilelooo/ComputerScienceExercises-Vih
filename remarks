terrible idea to follow a tutorial for multiple reasons as a newbie

impossible to diverge ideas from a certain point

complete the exercise : makes you discover the idiomatic way -> code is full of idiomatic rust which is very hard to appropriate
dismotivates to work ourself on the exercise because wrong code will always get obtained

if you diverge a little bit you cant catch up with the other exercices because they take as prerequisites

work with a code which is not ours

removes motivation

deadline => harder not to look directly at the correciton




things that i should have done

learn rust (hard)
have done this tutorial and redo it in the scope of the course
or take a more abstract tutorial

work with chatgpt





a lot of features can be implemented
hard to choose which features to implement, know when to stop coding



once the basis completed, lot easier to code even if the code may be hard




e,y scroll up down
